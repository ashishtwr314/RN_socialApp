# Social App in React Native

#### A instagram inspired app that lets you Singup, Login and then add Photos with a caption. You can click a picture or select one from your gallery and then upload
#### and all other peoples can have a look on whats you updated. Learned a lot of React and Native Device level stuff while building this. 
#### Its powered by Firebase in the backend for authentication and database and uses React, React Native, Native-Base and Redux at the frontend.
